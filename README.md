The "Applied Statistics Interview Grind" project requires students to provide solutions to 50 out of 80 interview questions in a concise and structured document. Additionally, they must create a dynamic video explaining answers to any five chosen questions. Evaluation criteria include content quality, problem-solving skills, conciseness, clarity, organization, video engagement, and time management. Submissions involve a well-structured document, a video recording, and appropriate file organization and naming conventions for submission.
